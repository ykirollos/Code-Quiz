# Code Quiz

## Link to Page


## Purpose

In this assignment, I created an MCQ Quiz that launches when the User click on the start button, which prompts the timer to start and the first question to appear.
Once the Submit button is clicked, the next question is displayed. For every incorrect answer, the timer deducts an extra 20 seconds.
When all questions are answered, or the time runs out, the score is announced, and the user is prompted to enter their name.
After submiting their name, the user can access their score by clicking on the Score Board button. There, the user can delete his score, or return to the quiz page.
